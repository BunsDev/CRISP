The Constant Rate Issuance Sales Protocol, or CRISP, is a mechanism that sells NFTs at a targeted rate over time. This repo prodives a sample solidity implementation, as well as a python notebook modeling the mechanisms behaviour. 

The solidity implementation was built using [Forge](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/tree/master/forge), [PRBMath](https://github.com/hifi-finance/prb-math) and [Solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate)
